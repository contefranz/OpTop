\title{Compute topic stability for over-optimal topic specifications}
\usage{
topic_stability(
  lda_models,
  optimal_model,
  q = 0.8,
  alpha = 0.05,
  do_plot = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{lda_models}{A list of ordered LDA models as estimated by
\code{\link[topicmodels]{LDA}}. The LDA models must be in ascending order
according to the number of topics.}

\item{optimal_model}{A number corresponding to the optimal topic model.}

\item{q}{Set a cutoff for important words as the quantile of the expected
cumulative probability of word weights. Default to 0.80, meaning that the 
function reaches 80\% of the distribution mass and leaves out the remaining
20\%.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha level to identify informative words from the Cumulative
Distribution Function over the cosine similarities in the Topic Word Weights
matrix. Default to 0.05.}

\item{do_plot}{Plot the chi-square statistic as a function of the number of 
topics. Default to \code{TRUE}. The horizontal dot-dashed line represents
the significance level according to \code{alpha}.}
}
\value{
A `data.table` containing the following columns:

\item{\code{topic}}{An integer giving the number of topics.}
\item{\code{df}}{An integer giving the degrees of freedom.}
\item{\code{chisq}}{A numeric giving the chi-square statistic.}
}
\description{
Implements fast chi-square like test to evaluate the stability of redundant
topics.
}
\details{
This function implements Test 3 as defined in 
Lewis and Grossetti (2019). Test 3 evaluates the aggregated 
stability of over-optimal topic specifications by summing each 
point-wise contribution. See 'Value' to understand how \code{topic_stability} 
returns the results.
