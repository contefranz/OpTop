# OpTop: detect the optimal number of topics from a pool of LDA models

## Overview

**OpTop** is the direct consequence of the paper _A Statistical Approach for 
Optimal Topic Model Identification_ by Lewis and Grossetti (2019). 

Latent Dirichelet Allocation (LDA) was developed by Blei, Ng, and Jordan in 2003
[Blei et al., (2003)] and is based on 
the idea that a corpus can be represented by a set of topics. LDA has been used 
extensively in computational linguistics, is replicable, and is automated so it 
cannot be influenced by researcher prejudice. LDA uses a likelihood approach to 
discover clusters of text, namely topics that frequently appear in a corpus.

One of the open challenges in topic modeling is to rigorously determine the 
optimal number of topics for a corpus. Since there are no well-defined heuristic 
approaches, researchers rely on iterative trial-and-error approaches.
A standard approach is to determine which specification is the least perplexed 
by the test sets. Perplexity is based on the intuition that a high degree of 
similarity, identified as a low level of perplexity, can be used to determine 
the appropriate number of topics [Blei et al., (2003); Hornik and Gr&uuml;n, (2011)].

**OpTop** introduces a set of parametric tests to find the optimal number of topics 
in a collection of LDA models. **OpTop** also includes 
several tests to explore topic stability and redundancy. 

## Installation

The package is not on CRAN yet. You can install the development version as follows:
``` r
# Install the development version from Github:
devtools::install_github( "contefranz/OpTop" )
```

## Functions

All the procedures described in the paper will be implemented in this package.
The package is in early alpha stage and contains two functions:

* `get_topic_models()`: handy function to immediately get the list of topic models
the user wants to process from a specified environment;

* `word_proportions()`: computes word proportions from a `corpus` object created 
by __quanteda__ [Benoit et al. (2018)];

* `optimal_topic()`: implements _Test 1_ from the methodological paper 
[Lewis and Grossetti (2019)].

* `topic_stability()`: implements _Test 3_ from the methodological paper 
[Lewis and Grossetti (2019)].

* `topic_match()`: detect and extract informative and uninformative components.

* `agg_topic_stability()`: implements _Test 4_ from the methodological paper 
[Lewis and Grossetti (2019)].

* `agg_document_stability()`: implements _Test 5_ from the methodological paper 
[Lewis and Grossetti (2019)].

More functions which implement the other tests are to come in future releases.
